Start

↓

1. Define Project Scope

Specify target RTS game (StarCraft II, custom environment, etc.)
Determine performance metrics (win rate, resource management, etc.)
↓

2. Set Up Game Environment

Choose development framework (Unity, Pygame, StarCraft II API)
Implement interfaces for agent actions, observations, and rewards
↓

3. Design RL Components

Select RL algorithm (Q-learning, DQN, PPO, DDPG)
Design state representation (unit positions, resources, terrain)
Define action space (movement, attack, build, resource management)
Create reward function (winning, resource gain, unit survival)
↓

4. Implement Reinforcement Learning Agent

Develop the agent using Python with libraries like OpenAI Gym
Integrate the agent with the game environment using PySC2 (if using StarCraft II)
↓

5. Train the Agent

Train the agent using the chosen RL algorithm with the defined state representation, action space, and reward function
Monitor performance metrics and adjust hyperparameters for optimization
↓

6. Evaluate and Improve

Test the trained agent against different opponents and scenarios
Analyze performance and identify areas for improvement
Refine state representation, action space, reward function, or RL algorithm
↓

7. Iterate and Refine

Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the agent achieves desired performance
